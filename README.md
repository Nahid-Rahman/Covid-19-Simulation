# Covid-19-Simulation

I created an pandemic (covid) virus simulation by watching Kytlin Videos on youtube.

He was inspired by and washington blogs posts on the Pandemic Corona and decided to make a simulation.
Blog link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/

I slightly changed some parameteres and updated+added few necessary parameters and class.

The population was based by the area I live in. Golartek, Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

It will work on greater populations too I hope. some condition just need to updated according to that.

After infected with Covid-19 twice I thought I should make something to remember the time I passed on 42 days Isolation.

If you increase the number of days of simulation (Currently 180 days / 6 months) and population it will take more time to cure fully.

Special Thanks to Kytlin for his amazing teaching and explanation skill. Thank you sir.

Thats all. Thanks...............
